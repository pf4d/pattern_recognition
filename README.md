Pattern recognition
=======

Collection of scripts generated for the University of Montana Fall term 2015 class taught by Dr. Douglas W. Raiford.

Written in `R`, the source folders include source code and documentation for the following topics:

1. Basics of the [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) programming language.

2. [Feature selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection).

3. [Multidimensional scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling).

4. [Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis).

5. [Linear discriminant analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis).

6. [Principal component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis).

7. [Edge detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection).

A final example is provided in the `Python` programming language investigates circumstances surrounding violent death through the years 1976 -- 2012 using methods of pattern recognition and machine learning.  The analysis indicates separability in the data when classifying by suburban and non-suburban environments, or by type of weapon used in the offense.  Note that the data for this investigation is not redistributable, and as such only the source code and final results are provided.
